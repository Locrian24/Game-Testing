Encodes each room created into a character string saved to a text file of the room's name. 

The script cycles through each room, encoding the room into a text file. Use SPACE to move to the next room

***IMPORTANT:*** Make sure the **oTemplateController** object is placed in the room and that it is at the **bottom** of the room's *Instance Creation Order*

*Note:* Can easily be optimised using [Run Length Encoding](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/run-length-encoding) as a simple encoder.
